Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to clean and explore the dataset, extract key insights using SQL queries, and present the results through an interactive dashboard and report.
This project demonstrates:
•	Data cleaning and exploration
•	SQL-based analysis
•	Business insight generation
•	Dashboard creation and reporting

Project Steps
1. Data Loading
•	Imported dataset using Python (Pandas)
•	Checked data structure, data types, and missing values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Analyzed customer distribution
•	Examined product categories and sales trends
•	Identified top-performing segments
3. Data Cleaning
•	Handled missing values
•	Removed duplicates
•	Standardized column names and formats
•	Converted data types where required
4. SQL Analysis
•	Loaded cleaned data into a SQL database
•	Ran analytical queries such as:
o	Total revenue by category
o	Top customers by spending
o	Monthly sales trends
o	Payment method analysis
